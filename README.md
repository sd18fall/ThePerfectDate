# Final Project: A Meta Video Game
### By: Sabrina Pereira, Sophie Schaffer, Cynthia Yong

We came together because of a class project. As different levels of video game fanatics, we had a wide collection of video games under our belts. However, we instantly fell in love with the idea of developing a text-based video game with a twist. With different learning goals in mind, we set out on an adventurous journey to see what we can do with python to bring this fantastic video game to life!

## To Get Started:
There is 1 library that is needed for this project:

1. Pygame: originally designed for writing video games, so we need it for program visualization and interaction
```
pip install pygame
```

Also, make sure to clone our repository so that you have all the files you need:

```
git clone https://github.com/sd18fall/ThePerfectDate
```

## Running the Program
Code to run the program: A screen should populate with the start page of the game

```
python3 game.py
```

## FAQs:


**Q: How long is the game?**

A: ~ 10 - 15 minutes

**Q: Will it require a lot of skill to play?**

A: Nope! It's a text-based game, so you just read what is displayed and click on buttons with your mouse to proceed forward.

**Q: Are there multiple endings?**

A: Yes! Depending on the options you select!

**Q: Is it fun?**

A: OF COURSE! DUH.

**Q: This game is amazing! How do I generate my own version?**

A: GLAD YOU ASKED. You can simply go into our "stageobject_mappings.py" file and you can edit the game plot in there!

Thank you to Tech With Tim for his pygame button code. His incredible tutorial is here: https://youtu.be/4_9twnEduFA

Thanks to Ted Klein Bergman for his answer on stackoverflow for how to render text with multiple lines in pygame. We used this to make the text fit into our text boxes and eventually create the scrolling effect. The original code can be found here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42014195/rendering-text-with-multiple-lines-in-pygame

Thanks to discopears for the wonderful Fluttershy's Cottage images that we used in our game. The files can be seen here: https://www.deviantart.com/discopears/journal/Fluttershy-s-Cottage-Release-Page-552687791

We used Flaticon's free images for our inventory icons.

The music in the game are the pieces "Beach" from the animated web series *Bee and Puppycat* and a sound clip taken from the music in the movie *Coraline*.

Files for miscellaneous sound effects are from Freesound.
