# Architectural Review: Reflection & Synthesis - MetaVideoGame
### By: Sabrina, Sophie, Cynthia

Overall, we received strong feedback in terms of both software and game design. In terms of software design, one common piece of feedback was having a “state machine” to keep track of the selections the user chooses throughout the game. Because we had wanted to keep our classes to a minimum and code simple, we didn’t think to add this. However, adding this could potentially be a huge lifesaver down the line when it might be too late to realize that we need something to keep track of the game progress. We also realized that we may have oversimplified the need for classes, so we will be adding more classes in the future when we begin to write the program.

Another piece of common general feedback that we received was related to game development was to immediately begin the code to make sure we have a working MVP before adding any complexities to it. Also, when working on a program between three students, it is necessary to add as much comments as you can to make sure everyone is on the same page with what is going on. These were all extremely helpful feedback, and moving forward, we plan on having a MVP completed by 11/12/2018 to leave us in a good shape for the week before Thanksgiving break. 

One area where we received a ton of valuable ideas and feedback was how to make the coding more complex while simultaneously making the game more compelling and interesting. Several ideas we heard that we are thinking about implementing are: 
1. **Having a character image appear next to the text:** emotionally connects the player to the character and makes the game more interesting to play
2. **Adding random chance:** this makes the game more attractive because users can play it multiple times without achieving the same result. They can also be surprised in multiple ways.
3. **Adding an inventory:** allows the player to see artifacts they have already seen and allows us to remove the artifacts from rooms after they have seen them, narrowing their choices for things to investigate and pushing the plot forward
4. **Adding a map:** makes the game and locations more visual, connecting the player to the world we have created more
5. Having all past actions matter instead of just the most recent decision: makes the game more personalized and more fun to replay
   -This will be a little hard to do from a plot perspective because it would introduce many different plot lines 


We received valuable feedback for our questions, both from our feedback form and during the feedback portion of our presentation. In the beginning, we gave too little context about the type of game we were creating, which confused the audience when it came to discussing program structure and risks because everyone had trouble understanding exactly the goal we were trying to achieve with our text based game. However, after giving some examples and answering some clarification questions, the audience had the context necessary and understood well what we are trying to achieve. This will serve us well for explaining more programming details in the second review because we will also be able to show screens from our functioning MVP. 

Additionally, although we did have a set agenda and came in knowing what questions we wanted to ask the audience, the conversation was fluid. We found it helpful that we did not adhere to a strict agenda and allowed the audience to ask whatever questions they pleased. For our second review, we would like to have some discussion topics, not just questions to be answered, in order to engage the audience in a conversation that will hopefully lead to more insights. We would also like to add more pictures in our presentation to further captivate the audience.
