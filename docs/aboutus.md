# ABOUT US

**We are three college students, 2 from Olin College of Engineering and 1 from Babson College that are working together on a final class project! If you had to describe us in two words it would be weird and cute (just like our game). We had a blast working, eating, and struggling together.**

### Thank you for visiting our website, and we hope you enjoy the game!

# MEET THE TEAM!

## **Sabrina Pereira**

Sabrina is a huge fan of turtlenecks and Shakira. She wakes up looking like she just put on make up. She likes... videogames? And this is kind of off topic but she does not get why people like spicy food when it just burns their mouths HOWEVER she really likes sour food. One day she is going to finally be happy, and it will be a good day.

## **Sophie Schaffer**

Sophie is a lover of raspberries and musicals. Her favorite animal is a puppy cat. She likes to work on finicky graphics problems and is quite the perfectionist when it comes to video games (apparently). All she wants to do right now is eat some chocolate and take a nap.

## **Cynthia Yong**

Cynthia is an avid fan of fresh smelling candles and organic hair products. While she loves practicing yoga and going hiking during her free time, she definitely loves to eat 24/7. She considers eating her favorite hobby. Eventually, her ultimate goal is to grow her own food and be an incredible plant mom!


# Project Lessons Learned:

* Code organization is super important if we want to maintain our sanity. There were times where we would work on the code individually and would have to explain to one another what we did. Had we kept our code in one giant file, it would have been a nightmare to figure out how each part works with one another and who added what. Now, whenever there is a bug, it is much easier for us to figure out the error because we know what part it came from and can make better educated guesses as to why the error occurred.

* This is related to the previous point, but distinguishing the function between each class was super helpful when writing code that combined everything.

* Creating an intricate game is definitely not easy! Even our simple, text-based 10 minute game required a TON of detail to enhance user experience and overall game visuals. We had to be detail orientated when thinking about all the little parts to add.

* Our game definitely wouldn't be where it is today without the help of our friends playing through it. Because we know our game inside and out, it was tremendously helpful to get fresh perspectives on what we could improve on.
