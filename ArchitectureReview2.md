# Architectural Review 2 - MetaVideoGame
### By: Sabrina, Sophie, Cynthia

Quick Background: A meta video game is a type of game that leads the player to believe in a certain outcome throughout the game, but surprises the player at the end with a completely different outcome that also fits the game plot. 

**Structural architecture includes:**
1. Model
   a. State Class: stores historical info, choices made by the user
   b. Key: Room buttons
   c. Key: Room buttons
2. Viewer
   a. Textbox Classes
   b. Button/ Backbutton / Response Button Classes
   c. Screen Class
   d. New Screen Function
   e. Button Placement Function
3. Controller
   a. Functions that deal with user mouse interactions

Up until now, we have completed a MVP that is able to transition between different screens depending on the choices the user selects. This is the backbone of our project as we have achieved the most basic form of our game. We were also able to add some visuals such as making the letters of the story appear one by one, having the buttons light up when scrolled over and implementing some background photos.

Currently, we are working to clearly separate our classes into model, view, and controller so we can better understand how each of the classes work with one another. We have also designed a way to store and display the game data and are working on implementation. Our plans moving forward include creating a document that takes user input and automatically populating the code with the necessary information so the game can function. Therefore, rather than having to go into the code to change information, the user only needs to update the document. 


### QUESTIONS:
1. What are your thoughts about our current classes?
2. What are your thoughts on the way we display our data using the stage and mapping object classes?
   a. Any new ideas come to mind?
3. What are your thoughts on the way we store our data?
4. Can you think of any additional mechanics that would make our game more interesting/our code more challenging to write?
