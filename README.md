# Final Project: A Meta Video Game
### By: Sabrina Pereira, Sophie Schaffer, Cynthia Yong

For our final project, we want to create a type of video game known as a "meta" video game. Essentially, the game starts off as one genre and surprises the player by switching to another genre at a certain point in the game. Our game is mainly text based as we want the player to form connections with the characters in the game, so they will be more surprised.

## To Get Started:
There is 1 library that is needed for this project:

1. Pygame: originally designed for writing video games, so we need it for program visualization and interaction
```
pip install pygame
```

## Running the Program
Code to run the program: A screen should populate with the start page of the game

```
python3 game.py
```

## License

This project falls under the MIT Open Source License and any other relevant license

## FAQs:

Question 1: Does this game have multiple endings

Answer: Yes, depending on the options you choose - you may end up with a completely different result!

Question 2: How long is the game?

Answer: It lasts about 5-10minutes depending on the options you choose and how carefully you want to read through the descriptions

Thank you to Tech With Tim for his pygame button code. His incredible tutorial is here: https://youtu.be/4_9twnEduFA

Thanks to Ted Klein Bergman for his answer on stackoverflow for how to render text with multiple lines in pygame. We used this to make the text fit into our text boxes and eventually create the scrolling effect. The original code can be found here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42014195/rendering-text-with-multiple-lines-in-pygame

Thanks to discopears for the wonderful Fluttershy's Cottage images that we used in our game. The files can be seen here: https://www.deviantart.com/discopears/journal/Fluttershy-s-Cottage-Release-Page-552687791

We used Flaticon's free images for our inventory icons.

The music in the game are the pieces "Beach" from the animated web series *Bee and Puppycat* and a sound clip taken from the music in the movie *Coraline*.

Files for miscellaneous sound effects are from Freesound.
