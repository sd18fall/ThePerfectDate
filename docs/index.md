# THE GAME INSPIRATION

We came together because of a class project. As different levels of video game fanatics, we had a wide collection of video games under our belts. However, we instantly fell in love with the idea of developing a text-based video game with a twist. With different learning goals in mind, we set out on an adventurous journey to see what we can do with python to bring this fantastic video game to life!
