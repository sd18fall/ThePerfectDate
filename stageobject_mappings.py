MetaGame: Game Data
Authors: Cynthia Yong, Sabrina Pereira, Sophie Schaffer


This file contains all of the Stages and related functions to run the game.
Think of Model.py and ViewerandController.py as the blueprint for generating a textbased game
and this file as the data for the game.

ONE IMPORTANT RULE: Be mindful of the order of stages. If you call a stage before it is made, then
the game will crash. One thing we did was to put the first screen the user sees at the bottom of
the list because it contains the buttons to everything else.


We decided to create a new file for inputting the game data in case users are interested in changing
the game plot. All they have to do is go in and edit the stages in this file without accidentally
changing the blueprint of the game. :)
