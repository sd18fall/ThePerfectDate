# Meet the Team !

## Sabrina Pereira

Sabrina is a huge fan of turtlenecks and Shakira. She wakes up looking like she just put on make up. She likes... videogames? And this is kind of off topic but she does not get why people like spicy food when it just burns their mouths HOWEVER she really likes sour food. One day she is going to finally be happy, and it will be a good day.

## Sophie Schaffer

Sophie is a lover of raspberries and musicals. She likes to work on finicky graphics problems and is annoyed at how long the town hall meeting is going. All she wants to do right now is eat some chocolate and take a nap

## Cynthia Yong

Cynthia is an avid fan of fresh smelling candles and organic hair products. She loves practicing yoga and going hiking during her free time. Her ultimate goal is to eventually grow her own food and be an incredible plant mom!
