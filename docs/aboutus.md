# ABOUT US

We are three college students, 2 from Olin College of Engineering and 1 from Babson College that are working together on a final class project! Upon brainstorming, we instantly fell in love with the idea of a text- based video game. With different learning goals in mind, we set out on an adventurous journey to see what we can do with python to bring this fantastic video game to life!

## Sabrina Pereira

Sabrina is a huge fan of turtlenecks and Shakira. She wakes up looking like she just put on make up. She likes... videogames? And this is kind of off topic but she does not get why people like spicy food when it just burns their mouths HOWEVER she really likes sour food. One day she is going to finally be happy, and it will be a good day.

## Sophie Schaffer

Sophie is a lover of raspberries and musicals. She likes to work on finicky graphics problems and is annoyed at how long the town hall meeting is going. All she wants to do right now is eat some chocolate and take a nap

## Cynthia Yong
